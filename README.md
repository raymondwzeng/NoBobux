# NoBobux
 Hides your Robux while on any Roblox subdomain.

# How to Use
1. Download the source, move the **extension** folder to anywhere you'd like.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`, enable developer mode on the top-right, and click `Load Unpacked` in the top-left.
3. Navigate to the folder and load the extension.

# How can I trust you with my bobux?
Look at the source. It's 2 lines. I commented what they do.

## Wait, why can't I just download it on the Chrome webstore™?

Because I'm too poor and/or too cheap to upload it. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯

(Plus the review process takes time)

Toss me a fiver on the Kofi and I'll do it I guess https://ko-fi.com/macandswiss
